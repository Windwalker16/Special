                In the canvas of time, you're my masterpiece,<br>
                Every moment with you brings eternal peace.<br>
                Your smile lights up my world like stars above,<br>
                You're the one I cherish, the one I love.

                <p>I spent last night on the last flight to you</p>
                <p>Took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh</p>
                <p>We spent the daylight tryna make things right between us</p>
                <p>But now it's all good, babe</p>
                <p>Roll that backwood, babe</p>
                <p>And play me close</p>

                <p>Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me</p>

                <p>I don't know where our paths will go,<br>
                If they'll stay the same or change and grow.<br>
                But right now, my heart is yours,<br>
                Through all the highs, through all the doors.</p>

                <p>I wish we could hold this, never let go,<br>
                But is forever real, or just for show?</p>

                <p>Some days we'll laugh, some days we'll miss,<br>
                But love like ours is built on this.</p>

                <p>Maybe we'll part, maybe we'll find,<br>
                A love that's stronger, more aligned.<br>
                So take my hand, don't be afraid,<br>
                Stay with me, don't let us fade.</p>

                <p>For now, let's hold what's in our hands,<br>
                No wasted time, no shifting sands.<br>
                And if someday we drift apart,<br>
                I hope we find our way—back to the start.</p>
            
                
                
                <p>--Promise that you'll always take care of yourself--</p>
                <p>--Promise that you'll Stay Happy and Healthy--</p>
                <p>--Happy Birthday, Aishe!!! love you so much :) --</p>
